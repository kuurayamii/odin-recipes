    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Batter:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup self-raising flour</li>
        <li>2 tbsps rice flour</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 cup lager-style beer, or more if needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Fish:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cod fillets, fully thawed if frozen</li>
        <li>2 tbsps rice flour or more if needed</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start the batter: Whisk self-rising flour, rice flour and baking powder together in a bowl. Freeze until ready to use.</li>
        <li>
            Make the fish: Pat cod as dry as possible, then cut lengthwise into eight 1-inch-thick strips. Place rice flour on a plate and season with salt. Dust cod lightly with the rice flour mixture
            and shake off any excess. Cover a plate with crinkled foil to make a quick drying rack; place cod on top.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 190C (Or 375 F)
        </li>
        <li>
            Finish the batter: remove flour mixture from the freezer. Pour in the beer and whisk
            until the batter's consistency is of a thick pancake batter, add more beer as needed
        </li>
        <li>
            Dip floured cod into the batter to coat; lift out and let excess drip off.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fry cod in batches until golden brown, dunking occasionally if needed
            3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Serve immediately.
